# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-and-Sales-Forecasting-for-Inventory-Optimization


## Overview
This project integrates customer segmentation analysis with time series forecasting techniques to optimize inventory levels. The analysis utilizes two main approaches: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), which are suitable for univariate time series data with and without seasonality, respectively.

## Objectives
1. **Customer Segmentation Analysis:**
   - Analyze buying patterns to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
   - Identify customer groups with distinct preferences and purchase frequencies.
   - Use these segments to tailor marketing strategies and inventory levels.

2. **Sales Forecasting:**
   - Implement ARIMA to forecast sales for products with no seasonality.
   - Extend to SARIMA for products with seasonal demand patterns.
   - Optimize inventory levels by predicting future demand and adjusting stock accordingly.

## Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess sales data, ensuring all data types are correct.
   - Aggregate data to a suitable time granularity for analysis.

2. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Use clustering algorithms to segment customers based on historical purchasing behavior.
   - Analyze and visualize customer segments.

3. **Sales Forecasting with ARIMA and SARIMA:**
   - Identify optimal parameters for ARIMA and SARIMA models using grid search or random search.
   - Train the models on historical data and validate their performance.
   - Forecast future sales and compute accuracy metrics (e.g., RMSE).

4. **Inventory Optimization:**
   - Use the forecasts from ARIMA and SARIMA to optimize inventory levels.
   - Adjust stock based on predicted future demand to avoid overstocking or stockouts.
   - Evaluate the impact of inventory optimization on costs and customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion
This project aims to enhance inventory management practices by combining customer segmentation analysis and advanced time series forecasting techniques. By understanding customer behavior and predicting future demand accurately, businesses can optimize inventory levels, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.
